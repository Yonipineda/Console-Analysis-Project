# Console-Analysis-Project
Google Colab Notebook contain the code for my Project

This Project was about the hisory of Playstation and Xbox. I wanted to know which console performed better in terms of sale, which console was the favored among fans and, what contributed to these outcomes. In my notebook, you'll find my analysis along with my sources, that dive into the global market share and US-based market share for the two of them. Also, you'll find further exploration into global sales, gaming genre and rating that sold most, and more.
